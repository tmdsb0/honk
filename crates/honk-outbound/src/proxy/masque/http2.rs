//! MASQUE connect-ip carrier over HTTP/2.
//!
//! Uses the extended CONNECT shape (RFC 8441) with Cloudflare's endpoint
//! conventions. Because HTTP/2 has no unreliable datagram, IP packets travel
//! as DATAGRAM capsules (RFC 9297) inside ordinary DATA frames — reliable and
//! ordered, which costs some latency but needs no QUIC DATAGRAM support.
//!
//! Two details differ from a textbook connect-ip client, both dictated by
//! Cloudflare's endpoints (and mirrored by `usque` and mihomo):
//!
//! * the request goes to `https://cloudflareaccess.com/`, **not** to
//!   `/.well-known/masque/ip/*/`, and carries `cf-connect-proto:
//!   cf-connect-ip` instead of relying on the `:protocol` pseudo-header;
//! * the tunnel addresses come from the node's configuration (`ip` / `ipv6`);
//!   the endpoint's ADDRESS_ASSIGN capsule is only a fallback.
