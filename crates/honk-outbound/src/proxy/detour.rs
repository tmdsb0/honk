//! The path a node takes out when it names a detour.
//!
//! A server the direct path out cannot reach is often reachable from another
//! node, so a node may name one — or a group, whose current member carries it.
//! Turning that name into a dial needs the node set, the groups and the proxy
//! registry, so the generation resolves it once and hands the node a
//! [`DetourPath`]. A group is the one part that cannot be resolved that early,
//! and it is resolved again on every dial instead.
//!
//! A dial through it yields the same byte stream a socket would, and for UDP
//! the same framed transport, so the protocol above does not have to know
//! which path it is on.
